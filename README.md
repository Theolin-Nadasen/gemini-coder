**Gemini Coder Pro â€” AI-Powered Coding Assistant for VS Code**

Take your coding productivity to the next level with Gemini Coder Pro â€” an AI extension built for real developers who want precision, clarity, and speed.

Unlike other AI tools, Gemini Coder Pro is non-intrusive â€” it will never modify or suggest code unless you explicitly ask it to. Youâ€™re always in control.

You can even view AI-suggested changes before applying them, so nothing gets overwritten unless youâ€™re ready.

## Features

âœ… **Generate Code**  
Let AI write entire functions or snippets based on your description.

âœ… **Add Comments**  
Smart, human-like comments explain what each part of your code does, making it easier to understand and maintain.

âœ… **Clean Code**  
Remove redundant lines, fix formatting, and eliminate clutter instantly.

âœ… **Selective Editing**  
Only selected text gets modified â€” Gemini uses the full file for context but edits just what you highlight. No selection? No problem â€” it can process the entire file too.

âœ… **Non-Intrusive by Design**  
The tool never runs in the background or changes anything without your command.

âœ… **Preview Changes**  
Choose to see suggested edits first â€” apply or reject with a single click.

ðŸ§  **Built for real-world developers**  
ðŸš€ **Lightweight, fast, and focused**
