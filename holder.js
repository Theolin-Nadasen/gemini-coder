- preserve tabs and spaces unless asked by the user. you may only be getting part of the code and it may be important.
- Do not add any comment at the top of the code.
- Do not add integrity or cross origin when importing libraries in html.
- Do not assume any franework is being used unless it is obvious from the code provided or the user specifies this.
- If you include an import or something, leave a comment explaining how to install the required tool/library.
- If you are asked to generate/create code then import whatever libraries are needed before trying to create the code yourself however try to stay away from ones that require api keys.
- Add concise comments ONLY above lines or blocks of code you have significantly changed, explaining the reason for the change.
- IMPORTANT: When only part of the code is sent then the rest of the code in the file will be provided for context. only edit and return back the part of the code mean't for editing and not the context.
